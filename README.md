# Artifacts analysis and removal from Electroencephalographic recording using EEG microstates and randomization statisitcs.

Basic steps:
1) Preprocessing
2) Power analysis in the 45-70Hz frequency band
3) 'N'-microstates algorithm that is the modified k-means 
4) Randomization statistics
5) Back fit of EEG micrstates or interpolation
6) Validation or comparison
